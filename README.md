# Multilayer graph modeling of gene expression data
This repository contains the code for the master thesis 2024/2025 in Data Science at Sapienza, University of Rome

## Model Description

## System Requirements

### Operating system 

For the model it was used a `Windows 11`  operating systems.

The model was trained using a computer with 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700H @ 2.3 GHz CPU, 16,0 GB of RAM.

To replicate the preprocessing pipeline, please refer to the respective system requirements.

### Python packages

The model was trained and tested using `Python 3.12.3` with the following packages versions:

- `numpy`: 1.26.4  
- `pandas`: 2.2.2  
- `matplotlib`: 3.9.2  
- `seaborn`: 0.13.2  
- `scikit-learn`: 1.5.1  
- `xgboost`: 3.0.0  
- `lightgbm`: 4.6.0  
- `torch`: 2.7.0+cpu  
- `statsmodels`: 0.14.2  
- `mygene`: 3.2.2
